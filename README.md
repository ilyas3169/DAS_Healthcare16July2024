This is the matlab simulation code which contains the Matlab code and data files for simulating a VFC-enabled infrastructure. The simulation uses greedy-heuristic approach based solution termed as "Divide and Schedule (DAS)" and four other resource allocation and schedueling methods.
### To compare the response latencies by the five different resource allocation and schedueling methods, ranging from MACTER, FVNET, LFT, SFT, BSM, and DAS, we used the following matlab data(.mat) and script (.m) files:
